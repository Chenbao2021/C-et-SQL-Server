# SQL
#### 1 - Function
- A function is a tool that used __to propduce an output__ for the provided inputs.
- In function, we can't use some DML statements like 'INSERT', 'DELETE', 'UPDATE', etc . (When asking a question,  we shouldn't change the result).
- It is a function, just like "SUM, COUNT, ..." that we used everytime.
- a function can be called by procedure, within a query(like SELECT)
- a scalar function must called by a username (or scheme).
- 
#### 2 - PROCEDURE
- A set of instruction which takes input and __performs a certain tasks__
- Its can also return values by OUTPUT parameters, and can return various values at once.
- A procedure cannot be called by function, within a query.
